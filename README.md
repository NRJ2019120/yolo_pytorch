# yolo_pytorch
A object recognize projects of yolo-simply refer yolov1/v2/v3.

##
1.Down load the VOC data,2007train/2007test/2012test/2012train at the same path.

2.Run "data/gendata.py "generate the train lebal and dataset.

3.Directly load my parms or initial  ,then,execute "train.py" 

4.Detect some images and show by run "detect.py"

5.Some detect result at "test_img_result"

**Notice
This project is a simple implement  for understanding object detection of yolo.
NO Classify predict 
Have some differents from the paper.
